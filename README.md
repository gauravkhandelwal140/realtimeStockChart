🚀 Showcasing My Latest Data Engineering Project! 🛠️

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on that combines real-time stock data visualization with cutting-edge technologies! Here's what I built:

🌟 Overview:
A real-time stock data platform that:

Generates stock data using Kafka Producer.
Streams data with Kafka Consumer to Django Channels for real-time updates on the UI using Highcharts.js.
Leverages Apache Spark to process and store this data efficiently in a PostgreSQL database.
🔑 Key Features:

Real-time Visualization: Stock prices are updated in real time, delivering an engaging user experience.
Scalable Architecture: Designed with Kafka and Spark to handle high-throughput data seamlessly.
Interactive UI: Used Highcharts.js for intuitive and interactive stock charts.
💡 Tech Stack:

Kafka for data generation and streaming
Spark for data processing and storage
Django Channels for real-time communication
Highcharts.js for dynamic stock data visualization
PostgreSQL for data persistence
This project has been an exciting journey, blending backend engineering, real-time data handling, and front-end visualization to create a seamless user experience. 🌐
